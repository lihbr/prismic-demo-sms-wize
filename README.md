## About

This website is made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) under [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), for detailed explanation on how things work please refer to related documentations.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

In order to improve `.sass` file compilation this projet relies on `fibers`. While you should not have any problem with it on Mac or Linux OS you need on Windows to have few more dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install -g node-gyp@latest
$ npm install -g --production windows-build-tools
```

<!-- Uncomment is using Netlify functions -->

<!-- As this project also makes use of [Netlify functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview), to run them locally you'll need the Netlify's cli:

```bash
$ npm install -g netlify-cli
``` -->

<!-- Uncomment if usage requires an internet connection -->

<!-- Finally the develop or build process of this project also require an internet connection in order to fetch content from CMS, offline usage is not possible. -->

### Install

After having the project cloned just install node dependencies:

```bash
# install dependencies with yarn
$ yarn install
# or with npm
$ npm install
```

During the process you can also create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example` and fill it with needed environment variables.

> Please note that the `.env` file also allow you to customize basic settings of the application though it's highly recommended to provide those value through a CMS

### Development

#### Start server without Netlify functions:

To run the project without Netlify functions simply run:

```bash
# launch nuxt development server with yarn
$ yarn dev
# or with npm
$ npm run dev
```

Nuxt development server will be running at `localhost:3000`

<!-- Uncomment is using Netlify functions -->

<!-- #### Start server with Netlify functions:

If you want the project with Netlify functions available run:

```bash
# launch nuxt development server with yarn
$ yarn dev:netlify
# or with npm
$ npm run dev:netlify
```

> Be aware that you need Nuxt server to run on `localhost` host for `netlify dev` to be able to wrap the server.

Nuxt development server will be running with functions at `localhost:8888` -->

#### Plop

Plop is configured on this project to generate regular components as well as pages and layouts one.

To use Plop you need its CLI installed globally, if you don't have it already you can install it this way:

```bash
# install plop globally with yarn
$ yarn global add plop
# or with npm
$ npm install --global plop
```

Then the `plop` command will guide you through creating desired components.

### Build

To build the project simply run:

```bash
# generate static project with yarn
$ yarn generate
# or with npm
$ npm run generate
```

You'll end up with the built site available at `./dist`
